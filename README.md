- restcountries api responds with {404: not found} when searching by 'official' or 'common' country name provided in their own responses. For some you need to use the common and others the official. Can't detect a pattern.
  For example, Guatemala is only found by it's common name, and North Korea is only found with it's official name.
  Wouldn't be an issue if they didn't list border countries by their code but by their actual name.
